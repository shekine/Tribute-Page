    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Hayao Miyazaki is world renowned for his work in animated films. The animation studio that he cofounded, Studio Ghibli, has spawned such works as Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle. His works are approachable from a broad variety of people young and old, and, in a way, contain an element of timelessness. While he has not created any feature films in the past few years, his works remain an inspiration to artists and creators worldwide including this writer. </p>
    <h2>Early Animation Career</h2>
    <p>Hayao Miyazaki was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1941. Although his early years were formative for his artwork, his animation career really began post graduation when he began working for Toei Animation. He worked on various feature films and TV series there between 1963 and 1971. Miyazaki moved around to a few different studios in the years following and, eventually, he wrote a manga titled <i>Nausicaa, of the Valley of the Wind</i> that would be adapted into a film and solidify him in his field.</p>
    <h2>Studio Ghibli</h2>
    <p>After the success of <i>Nausicaa, of the Valley of the Wind</i>, Miyazaki cofounded Studio Ghibli with several other animators which created some of the most renowned animated films of this generation. Some of the works he took part in are listed below.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1986 - <i>Castle in the Sky</i></li>
